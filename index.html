     <p>Just last year alone, there were 38 school shootings that resulted in a total of 42 people injured and 21 dead.</p>

    <p>That number adds to the previous 120 school shootings that took place between 2018-2022, and gives us a catestrophic 158 shootings, that could have been prevented.</p>

    <p>As of April 18th, there have already been 14 school shootings across the U.S, resulting in 9 deaths and 25 injuries.</p>

    <p>We need to prioritize this issue before we're too late.</p>
